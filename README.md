## 01 - Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

### Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning
* Define machine learning
* Define supervised learning
* Define unsupervised learning
* Write and run Python code in Jupyter Notebooks
* Define a regression model
* Implement and visualize a cost function
* Implement gradient descent
* Optimize a regression model using gradient descent

### Week 2: Regression with multiple input variables
* Use vectorization to implement multiple linear regression
* Use feature scaling, feature engineering, and polynomial regression to * improve model training
* Implement linear regression in code

### Week 3: Classification
* Use logistic regression for binary classification
* Implement logistic regression for binary classification
* Address overfitting using regularization, to improve model performance
